# MyWave App ðŸŒŠ

Welcome to the **MyWave App**! This repository contains the front-end code for my masterâ€™s project, where I developed a mobile application using React Native (primarily in JavaScript) and Expo Go, allowing me to run the development server directly on my iPhone!

This project provided an incredible opportunity to build a simple yet effective application that displays real-time data on wave and ocean conditions, perfect for surfers eager to catch the best waves. I had a fantastic time working on it, and while the code isn't flawless, it was a valuable experience that allowed me to experiment, learn, and immerse myself in the development process.

The core of the project lies in the front-end code. I utilized Django (Python) for the back end, along with a straightforward database to manage surf locations via the Django admin panel. Instead of tying locations to a user database, I opted for local storage on the front end to simplify the process and avoid handling user data. The primary role of Django was to connect to the RESTful web service, enabling access to live data provided by Stormglass.io.
