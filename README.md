# MyWave App ðŸŒŠ

Welcome to the **MyWave App**! This is the front-end code for my masterâ€™s project, where I developed a mobile application using React Native (mostly in JavaScript) and Expo Go to run the development server right from my iPhone!

This project was a fantastic opportunity for me to create a simple yet effective application that displays real-time data on wave and ocean conditions, perfect for surfers looking to catch the best waves. I had a blast working on it, and while the code may not be perfect, it allowed me to experiment, learn, and really dive into the development process.

## Main Features

- **Real-Time Wave Info:** Stay updated with the latest wave heights and ocean conditions at your favorite surf spots.
- **Interactive Map:** Explore surf locations on an interactive map and click for more details on each spot.
- **Save Your Favorites:** Easily keep track of your go-to surf spots for quick access!
